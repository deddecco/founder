<section><h2>Early Life</h2></section>
<p>Vint Cerf was born in 1943 in Connecticut, but by his high school days had moved to Los Angeles. In <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmqLuwcRvMM">this video at about 3:30</a>, Vint Cerf tells the Q&A
    audience at Google that he want to high school in Los Angeles with several important figures in the history of the
    internet
    who were just a few years ahead of or behind him.</p>
<section><h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Born in 1943, Vint Cerf would go on to graduate from Stanford in mathematics. After some time at IBM, Cerf went
        to
        graduate school,
        earning both a Masters and a PhD in computer science from UCLA, according to the <a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vinton-Cerf">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>. </p>
    <p>While he pursued graduate studies, he worked under Leonard Kleinrock with Bob Kahn and others to develop what
        became ARPANET and laid the groundwork for modern packet-switching frameworks. The archived meeting notes from
        the group, including John Postel, of fame for his work on the DNS, Kleinrock, and Cerf and Steve Crocker (both
        involved with ICANN) is available in the <a href="sources.html">Sources</a> section of this website.</p>

<section><h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
        Vint Cerf has worked in a number of places fundamental to the internet and computing in general. Before graduate
        studies, his first job having finished his bachelor's was at IBM. Even before them, he had briefly held summer
        positions at NASA working on writing software to test Apollo rocket engines.
    </p>
    <p>After finishing his PhD, Cerf worked as a professor and for the DoD. For almost 20 years, he has been at Google
        as "Chief Internet Evangelist" and one of their vice presidents. He also helped establish, and has sat on the
        board of ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the body that regulates top-level
        domains like .com or .org or .net-- but which now has hundreds more domains which it allows people to register,
        far more than the few it started out with. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd3dH90tdhk">This video
            narrated by Cerf himself</a> explains what
        ICANN does and how
        it came about.</p>
