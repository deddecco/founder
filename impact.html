<h2>TCP/IP in the real world</h2>
<p>We use TCP/IP every day as a backbone of the modern internet. The Erie Institute of Technology says that, <i>"TCP and
    IP are two sides of the same coin. They each provide their own important functions
    for
    the delivery of data for the TCP/IP protocol. The TCP does the work to allow data to be received between two
    connected computers. IP finds the destination, or location, of the communicating computers, allowing the data to
    be
    transmitted between the two correct devices or internet applications."</i> The delivery of this information
    happens in
    small chunks called "packets." The <a href="gallery.html">Gallery page</a> has a diagram of a packet.

    Certain types of data can be transmitted in a way that
    some information loss-- like a picture or video getting slightly grainier-- is OK. Other types of data, like the
    text content
    of
    an email from a junior employee to their boss, need to be transmitted perfectly: everything arrives to the right
    receiver, from the right sender, without any damage to the data along the way. <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO_dSHEtp_Y">This video from
        NordVPN</a> helps explain
    why someone would use TCP/IP.
</p>
<p>For having invented TCP/IP, in 2005, Vint Cerf won the Turing Award given by the ACM-- considered in the industry to
    be as prestigious in computer science as a Nobel would be in a field that has one. The citation is available to read
    on the
    <a href="gallery.html">Photo Gallery</a> page. </p>
<p>Every day, we make use of TCP/IP billions of times a day, and most of the time we aren't even aware that it is
    helping us-- to email a boss, to watch a YouTube video, to get directions to a new restaurant, and so
    much more. </p>
