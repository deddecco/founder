<h2>What is TCP/IP?</h2>
<p>TCP stands for "Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol." Protocols are the sets of standards we use to
    correctly, safely, and quickly move information around the internet. TCP/IP ensures, unlike UDP, which is another
    protocol, that all the data gets from point A to point B losslessly. You
    might use UDP behind the scenes on a Zoom call-- your image might get grainy, or you could hear a few seconds of
    choppy audio, but most of the audio and video still makes it through to the other end, even if not perfectly--where
    speed takes the place of accuracy as teh primary concern. But when accuracy matters most, like
    in making sure all the contents of an email get to their destination, you will TCP. TCP keeps track of which
    packets have been sent and
    which ones have been received and can resend those which encountered issues along the way. It doesn't matter if
    packets come in out of order, because there will be processes at the destination that put the packets in the proper
    order, </p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEaKrq3SpW8">Crash Course Computer Science video</a>, TCP
    does this primarily with two functionalities: </p>
<ul>
    <li>checksums</li>
    <li>ack messages</li>
</ul>
<p>Checksums-- also found in things like credit card numbers-- allow the data to validate itself. You probably can't
    guess
    a credit card number at random, so it would be quite hard to have illicit purchases on your account that way,
    precisely
    because the payment processor is looking for the sum of the digits of your card number, possibly mod something else,
    to
    yield a certain result. TCP uses checksums to make sure the data in the packet on the sending end hasn't changed by
    the time it gets to the receiving end. There is some formula for calculating the checksum of the data in the TCP
    packet, which is checked when the package is sent and recalculated when the package is received. If they match, the
    data got through without issues. If the check sum is right, your packet is accepted. If the checksum is right,
    you'll be allowed to check out from the online store. If not, something corrupted the package, and it can be
    requested again because the
    sequence in which packets are sent is known. </p>

<p>Acknowledgements work by sending extra messages across the network-- slowing down the transfer of information-- to
    let the sender
    know the receiver got their packet. You can send packet 1, get an ack, send packet 2, get an ack, send packet 3...
    get nothing... and then you know there was some kind of problem and packet 3 needs to be resent, That can either
    happen before you send packet 4, or when you're done sending however many packets you have, because one of the
    benefits of TCP is that it keeps track of the order of the reassembly of the packets. </p>
<p>According to PCMag, these acknowledgement messages take 3 steps:
<ol>
    <li>synchronize</li>
    <li>acknowledge the first packet</li>
    <li>acknowledge the acknowledgement</li>
</ol>

    This picture from Techopedia shows the TCP/IP handshake process:

     alt="a diagram showing the 3 stage process of the TCP/IP handshake">
<p>
    With this 3-way handshake protocol, both ends of a connection speaking the language of TCP/IP know they can hear
    each
    other. One message is sent to "synchronize," then a "synchronize acknowledge" message is sent in the opposite
    direction to acknowledge the first message, and finally a third message is sent in the original direction to
    acknowledge the second, and the connection is made.
