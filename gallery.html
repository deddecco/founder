            His citation for the Medal, explaining why he was awarded it, taken from the White House's website, reads,
            <p>"More than 30 years ago, Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn designed the architecture and communication protocol
                that gave rise to the modern Internet. The innovative work of these two pioneers laid the foundation for
                a
                global transformation of communication, commerce, and entertainment. The United States honors Vinton
                Cerf
                and Robert Kahn for their outstanding contributions to science and for improving the lives of all
                Americans." Cerf is with Kahn and the President in the picture.</p>

            transmitted.

        <td class="desc">A comparison between the TCP/IP and OSI models. OSI has 7 layers, while TCP/IP has only 4.
            Several layers in OSI-- another protocol for managing the flow of information across networks-- collapse
            into single layers in the TCP/IP scheme. The modern internet is built around TCP/IP rather than OSI.
            However, both models allow computers to communicate with each other and exchange information between
            themselves.

            prize reads as follows:"With Robert E. Kahn, for pioneering work on internetworking, including the design
            and implementation of the Internet's basic communications protocols, TCP/IP, and for inspired leadership in
